After an ensouled being's mortal shell expires, their essential spirit and ego, known as a soul, is transported to [[Limbo]], traditionally to await judgment before proceeding to the appropriate afterlife.

When a Wayward Soul arrives in limbo, they find themselves grasping for the last fleeting moments of their mortal lives as they emerge into the inky [[Nyxian Sea]]. However they make it to black sandy shore, they find that have forgotten almost everything about who they once were and must make their way in this strange new world.

These days, Wayward Souls find themselves unable to escape the place of judgment they find themselves in. Instead, they roam the alien lands of Limbo in hopes of finding answers about themselves or building a new life in this bizzare land.
