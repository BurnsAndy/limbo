While one chapter of life ended before [[Wayward Soul]]s find themselves in [[Limbo]], for some, the plane of judgment is the beginning. While, for all intents and purposes, the souls that wash ashore in Limbo are dead, they are very much still living beings of flesh and blood.

Those who believe themselves immune to biological processes find themselves quickly chagrined when they discover things function more or less the same as when they were originally alive.

This has led to new souls being formed in Limbo. While academics and philosophers have many theories on if these new souls are truly as real as the wayward ones. But to those who have brought new souls into this world find the simplest thing to call them is their children.
