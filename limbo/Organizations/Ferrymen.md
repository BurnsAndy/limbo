A benevolent organization that serves the purpose of retrieving the wayward souls that emerge from the [[Nyxian Sea]].

The organization's goal is to help [[Wayward Soul]]s find their place in [[Limbo]]. They frequently send boat patrols out into the sea to retrieve those emerging from the black, starry waters. Upon bringing the amnesiac wretches to shore, they do what they can to integrate them into society, usually by providing jobs either in their organization, around town, or more dangerous quests to ensure the safety of their locales. 

The Ferrymen do their best to keep a record of the souls they pull from the sea. The data they collect helps maintain records of who is new to Limbo and who has already been trapped in this land before.
