Tartarus is the largest settlement in the [[Blackshore]] region. Most refer to it as a city, though those with memories of the sprawling metropolises of the old world would argue against the use of the term.

The city houses a chapter of the guild of [[Ferrymen]]. Their efforts add to the growing population of this burgeoning settlement.
