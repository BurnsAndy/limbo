The Darkwood is a large area that can be best described as a forest, though most may categorize the flora that makes up the forest with the loosest definition of "tree".

It is a dangerous place, full of strange beasts, monsters, and [[Lost]] souls, but trails have been blazed and travelers cross the woods in packs, hoping that the safety of numbers will protect them from the threats within.
