Whenever a character is reduced to 0 HP and is downed, they must make a CON saving throw equal to half the damage that downed them or 10, whichever is higher.

If the character fails their save, roll **d8 + d12** and consult the below table. The character then receives the injury. It is advised that players and the DM record the injury, where the character is wounded, and how the character received the injury.

|Roll (d8+d12)|Result|
|:--|:--|
|2|Lose an Eye|
|3|Lose a Leg or a Foot|
|4-7|Limp|
|8-11|Minor Scar|
|12-13|Broken Ribs|
|14-15|Internal Injury|
|16-17|Horrible Scar|
|18-19|Festering Wound|
|20|Lose an Arm or Hand|
While described as "Permanent", these injuries can be remedied in different ways. Some can be healed with proper treatment and rest. Others can only be fixed by magical means, such as the *Regeneration* spell.
