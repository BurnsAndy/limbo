You have emerged from the [[Nyxian Sea]] with only memories of your final moments. While your physical appearance may bear some signs of what destroyed your mortal shell, it may appear entirely different. You may appear a different age, have altered physical features, or bear new marks that seem to have nothing to do with how you died.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Pick any two skills
**Tool Proficiencies:** Pick one type of tool
**Language:** One of your choice
**Equipment:** *None*

### Final Moments
Before arriving (or re-arriving) in [[Limbo]], how did you die? Feel free to roll on the table below, select a cause of death most interesting to you, or come up with something that is not on the list. You only have memories of the last few moments before your death, but not the context leading up to it.

### Feature: Draw From a Past Life
While the mind may not remember who you were before death, the body does. Once per long rest, you may temporarily gain one of these bonuses:

- Proficiency in a skill of your choice
- Advantage on your next roll
- Reroll a die you just rolled before the DM informs you of the result of the check
- If you have the ability to cast magic, regain a single spell slot at a level no higher than the median of the spell levels available to you (*i.e.* If the highest level spell you can cast is Level 3, regain no more than a Level 2 spell slot.)
- If you have the ability to cast magic, gain the ability to cast a spell from a spell list unavailable to you once. This spell's level can be no higher than your median available spell level.

When you use this feature, describe how your character suddenly gains this ability. Are they overcome with a brief memory of a past life? Does their body seem to act on its own via muscle memory? Are they utterly bewildered in this sudden occurrence?
What ever you choose, make a note of what ability you used and how you used it. You may find yourself filling in more of the blanks about your character's lost memories.


### Suggested Characteristics
While you may not have memories of who you were, even in death, habits are heard to break.

| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | I am always calm, no matter what the situation. I never raise my voice or let my emotions control me.                   |
| 2   | I see omens in every event and action. The gods try to speak to us, we just need to listen. They have not abandoned us. |
| 3   | I judge people by their actions, not their words.                                                                       |
| 4   | I don’t like to get my hands dirty, and I won’t be caught dead in unsuitable accommodations.                            |
| 5   | I’m used to helping out those who aren’t as smart as I am, and I patiently explain anything and everything to others.   |
| 6   | I face problems head-on. A simple, direct solution is the best path to success.                                         |
| 7   | I am horribly, horribly awkward in social situations.                                                                   |
| 8   | I enjoy being strong and like breaking things.                                                                          |

| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Charity.** I always try to help those in need, no matter what the personal cost. (Good)                                                   |
| 2   | **Freedom.** Chains are meant to be broken, as are those who would forge them. (Chaotic)                                                    |
| 3   |                                                                                                                                             |
| 4   | **Might.** If I become strong, I can take what I want — what I deserve. (Evil)                                                              |
| 5   | **Live and Let Live.** Ideals aren’t worth killing over or going to war for. (Neutral)                                                      |
| 6   | **Responsibility.** I do what I must and obey just authority. (Lawful)                                                                      |
| 7   | **Redemption.** There’s a spark of good in everyone. (Good)                                                                                 |
| 8   | **People.** I’m loyal to my friends, not to any ideals, and everyone else can find themselves floating in the Nyx for all I care. (Neutral) |

| 1   | Who was I?                                           |
| 2   | What did I lose?                                     |
| 3   | There must be some kind of way out of here.          |
| 4   | Why have the gods abandoned this place?              |
| 5   | Let the past die. Kill it, if you have to.           |
| 6   | Everything I do is for the common people.            |
| 7   | I protect those who cannot protect themselves.       |
| 8   | Those who fight beside me are those worth dying for. |

| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | That which killed me still leaves me quivering with fear.                        |
| 2   | I can’t keep a secret to save my life, or anyone else’s.                         |
| 3   | I am easily distracted by the promise of information.                            |
| 4   | I secretly believe that everyone is beneath me.                                  |
| 5   | I have a weakness for the vices of the city, especially hard drink.              |
| 6   | When I see something valuable, I can’t think about anything but how to steal it. |
| 7   | If there’s a plan, I’ll forget it. If I don’t forget it, I’ll ignore it.         |
| 8   | I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst of them.                       |
