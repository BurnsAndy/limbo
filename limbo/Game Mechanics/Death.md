While still a terrible thing, death is not so permeant in [[Limbo]] as it was in the [[Old World]].

When one's mortal shell expires in the lands of Limbo, their soul eventually finds itself once again emerging in a new body in the [[Nyxian Sea]]. There are drawbacks to this rebirth. Despite great efforts, the time it takes for a soul to remerge seems to be random. Sometimes they reappear within moments of their most recent death and other times, it can take days, months, or years before these souls are seen again. There are many theories as to what exactly influences the time it takes for a soul to reemerge, scholars agree on one thing: they just don't know.

Additionally, these reemerged souls find themselves stripped of their previous memories and experiences made in Limbo. They find themselves as fresh and confused as the day they first died and appeared there.

Of course, there are rumors of ways to retain memories beyond deaths, but between charlatans, cults, and other opportunists, most of these rumors turn out to be just that.

In game mechanic terms, *death is no longer the end* for a character in Limbo. 

When a character dies, the time it takes for a soul to reemerge is up to the DM's discretion. When that soul reemerges, they may have a slightly different appearance, either finding their body regressed to the age they were at their original death or sometimes with fresh scars denoting a previous, violent death.

Any reemerged souls find themselves bereft of their experiences of Limbo, meaning **they restart as a Level 1 character with no memories of their adventures or companions.**

If a player's character dies, it is up to them what details have changed after their character reemerged. **They can select a new class at Level 1.**

Alternatively, a player is always allowed to create an entire new character to play.

It is up to that player and the DM to determine the best way to fit their new or returning character back into the campaign.

**Persistent Death Saving Throws and Other Effects:** 
- When a character is reduced to 0 HP and fails a death saving throw, **the Death Save counter is not reset when the character regains consciousness.** Instead, **a character may remove one failed Death Save per Long Rest.**
- Whenever a character is downed, they must make a CON saving throw with a DC equal to half the damage that downed them or 10, whichever is higher. If failed, they must roll on the [[Permanent Injuries]] table. Permanent injuries are normally lost on death and reemergence, though may be retained at the player's discretion.
