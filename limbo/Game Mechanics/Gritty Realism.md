While death is only a setback, preventing it is no easy task.

The campaign taking place in [[Limbo]] will abide by the Gritty Realism rules that can be found in the Dungeon Master's guide.

These rules mean that healing is a much slower process, with Short Rests taking a full night's rest and Long Rests taking anywhere from a week to a month.

This will require players to plan around this extended downtime. Whether that means building characters less reliant on rests, avoiding expending resources in encounters, or some combination of the two, is entirely up to them.

This may require a rework of some existing features and rules (i.e. Arcane Recovery), it is entirely up to the DM's discretion how they would prefer to handle these things as the campaign progresses.

To encourage solutions other than combat, the DM can allow the following concessions to the players:
- Each Player Character can take a free non-combat feat at the 1st Level
- All spellcasters can use Ritual Magic
- Player Characters can use extended downtime to train new proficiencies

If, in practice, it is determined that the group is not enjoying the Gritty Realism rules, the DM can make adjustments to these rules and the game world to accommodate a more fun experience while retaining the narrative effects of this alternate ruleset.
