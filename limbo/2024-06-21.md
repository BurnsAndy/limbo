The start of something new.

Limbo is an idea for a campaign setting I've had bouncing around in my head for a while now. I wanted a place full of danger and adventure that was different than the usual fantasy fare. With Limbo, I have a setting that can include just about anything while still remaining in its D&D-inspired roots. 

Limbo is the place between places. A transitory world. Or, at least, it was meant to be. After death, all souls pass through Limbo before being judged and sent to their appropriate afterlife. While some of that functionality remains, the process broke somewhere along the way.

These days, the souls that arrive in Limbo never leave.
